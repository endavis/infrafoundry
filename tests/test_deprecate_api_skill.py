"""The two `deprecate-api` bodies must agree, and neither may skip a release boundary.

Retiring a public name safely means two things happen in the right order, releases apart: callers
are warned before anything is deleted, and a `pytest.warns` test is the one thing this project's
pytest configuration (`--strict-config --strict-markers`, no `filterwarnings`) will ever use to
catch a shim that quietly stops warning (#832).

Two surfaces carry it -- `.claude/commands/` for Claude, `.agents/skills/` for Codex, Antigravity
and Copilot -- and whichever agent the user drives decides which body applies. A step present in
one and missing from the other is a control that fires for some users and not others. The bodies
are deliberately not byte-identical, since invocation syntax differs per host, so what is asserted
is the contract and its ordering.

Scoped to the agents a project actually wires, per `tests/agent_roster.py` (#690).
