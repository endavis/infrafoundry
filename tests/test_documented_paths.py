"""A path named in the docs should exist, or be a declared placeholder.

`test_markdown_links.py` resolves link *targets* and `test_instruction_pointers.py`
resolves quoted section references and command names. Neither looks at a path
written in backticks in prose, which is how four stale references survived
long enough to be found by a manual sweep (#773):

- `.claude/claude.md` -- named four times, wrong case, and one of them an
  instruction to *verify* a file that does not exist under that name;
- `docs/installation.md`, `docs/usage.md`, `docs/api.md` in the migration guide,
  all three moved when the documentation was reorganised;
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml`, a workflow the reader was told to create;
- `.github/copilot/settings.json`, a settings file neither this repo nor the
  Copilot CLI has.

The allowlist below is the interesting half. A doc legitimately names paths that
do not exist -- placeholders substituted during setup, files created at runtime,
worked examples. Each entry states which, so the list stays a set of decisions
rather than a pile of suppressions.

Discovery is `doc_scan.committed_markdown_files()` -- git-tracked plus untracked-
but-not-ignored markdown -- rather than `rglob()` minus a hardcoded skip set. A
downstream project can also silence a path it deliberately did not adopt via
`.config/pyproject_template/sync-exclude.toml` (ADR-9026); upstream has no such
file, so that skip is a no-op here.
