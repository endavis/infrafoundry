"""Tests for the CI (full matrix) dispatch workflow configuration.

These tests are structural asserts on the parsed YAML. They do not execute the
workflow -- they only verify its shape.

This workflow exists to preserve the ``full-matrix`` label UX (adding the
label on a PR triggers a run across the middle Python versions) while keeping
the ``labeled`` event off the main ``ci.yml`` trigger list (see
pyproject-template#424). The dispatch job is a thin wrapper: a single ``if:``
guard checks the label name, then delegates to ``ci.yml`` via
``workflow_call`` with ``full_matrix: true``.
