"""The two `perf-change` bodies must agree, and neither may report a speedup unmeasured.

`.claude/rules/verified-claims.md` exists because an agent will otherwise report a speedup it
read off the code rather than measured. This project already ships the tools to measure one --
`tests/benchmarks/`, `doit benchmark`, `doit benchmark_save`, `doit benchmark_compare`, and a CI
workflow that tracks results over time -- but shipped no procedure that drives them in the order
that keeps a claimed speedup honest (#836).

The local loop also had a trap: `doit benchmark_compare` used to be pinned to the first save
(`0001_baseline`), so a second baseline in the same scratch storage directory compared against
the oldest run instead of the one just taken. #840 (merged as `c9f664f`) made
`--benchmark-compare` use the latest saved run instead, which is what makes running the loop
as-is (rather than working around the pin) trustworthy.

Two surfaces carry it -- `.claude/commands/` for Claude, `.agents/skills/` for Codex, Antigravity
and Copilot -- and whichever agent the user drives decides which body applies. A step present in
one and missing from the other is a control that fires for some users and not others. The bodies
are deliberately not byte-identical, since invocation syntax and scratch-file paths differ per
host, so what is asserted is the contract and its ordering.

Scoped to the agents a project actually wires, per `tests/agent_roster.py` (#690).
